# Code Challenges

## What are these?

- Challenges that will test your **breadth** of knowledge with __certain languages__, or even a __language of your choice!__
- **NOTE**: our preferred languages are:
  - Javascript/Typescript
  - SQL (particularly T_SQL)
  - PHP
  - C#
  - Python
- ...but if you want to wow us with something else, feel free!

## Why would you want to do any of these?

- As a rule, you should **prioritize** your respective **Frontend/Backend/QA** challenges before these
- These challenges are **optional** and only serve to give us a better idea of how you code
- If you feel **you have more to show** after the main code challenges, do one (or more!) of these
