## eBacon SQL Todo Test
The point of this exercise is for us to get an idea of how you write SQL and Problem Solve
The team is building a small todo app.
Your task is to update the tables and stored procedure to allow the calls to it at the bottom of this file to work.

Try not to change the exec calls unless you feel it is necessary; the front end team is building against this.
Feel free to change as much of the SQL side as you see fit. We just provided a starting point.
